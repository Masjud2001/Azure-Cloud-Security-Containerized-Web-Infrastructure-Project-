#🚀 Project Overview

I designed and deployed a secure Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure using multiple Linux virtual machines, network security controls, and containerized applications. The environment was built as a personal cybersecurity lab to practice cloud security, Docker containerization, and network hardening techniques.

🏗️ Architecture Components
🔹 Virtual Machines (Linux)

Jump Box (Bastion Host) – Secure administrative access point

Web-1 – Web server running containerized application

Web-2 – Web server for redundancy and load balancing

🔹 Networking & Security

Configured Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to enforce least-privilege inbound and outbound traffic rules

Reduced public attack surface by restricting direct access to internal servers

Implemented Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across Web-1 and Web-2 for high availability

🔹 Docker & Containerization

Built and deployed a containerized web application using Docker

Managed Docker containers on Linux VMs to ensure isolated and consistent deployments

Used containers for hosting a practice website for cybersecurity testing

🔐 Security & Validation

Configured secure administrative access via Jump Box

Tested connectivity and verified open ports

Validated access controls and firewall rules

Ensured internal servers were not directly exposed to the public internet

🧪 Purpose of the Lab
